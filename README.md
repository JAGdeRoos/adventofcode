# Advent of Code solutions

This repository contains my Qt C++ solutions to some of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

The solutions do not optimize any given parameter: They are not the shortest possible solutions, they are not the fastest possible solutions. They are also not the most readable solutions, they are the solutions I came up with.
